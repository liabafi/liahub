# Lia's MacBook Pro

Lia‚Äôs MacBook Pro is a portfolio website created as a web Simulation of macOS Big Sur using Flutter web. The idea is to provide a glimpse at my personal MacBook Pro. The project shows the power of Flutter Web in action.


The project started as a minimal project and later took it shape into this.
